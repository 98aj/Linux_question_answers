Q 2. What is the difference between Hard Link & Soft Link?
===> Hard link or soft link are shortcut links that points the files or directory
        Hard link : 
        1. Hard link points to same inode of file or directory
        2. If we deleted orignal file hard link remains alive can content inside it is not deleted
        3. If original file is changed then content of hardlink file also gets updated
        4. Hard links does not work across different file systems or partitions 
        5. Hard links point directly to the file with same inode (index node) as the original file.

        Soft link:
        1. Soft link points to the name or path of the original file
        2. If deleted orignal file soft link also deleted
        3. If original file is changed then softlink file also change

===> Step 1: Create user p1 : sudo useradd p1
     Step 2: He should be part of 3 groups g1,g2,g3 : sudo usermod -a -G g1,g2,g3 p1
     Step 3: Set default group to g1 : sudo usermod -g g1 p1

Q 7. Directory cretion and permissions assigning task
===> Step 1:  Create directory /tmp/bg as root user and create files inside it
     => sudo mkdir /tmp/bg
     => cd /tmp/bg
     => sudo touch file.txt

     Step 2: “abhi” should be the owner of the directory. He should be able to create files and delete files inside the directory and also he should b
     => sudo chown -R abhi /tmp/bg
     => chmod -R 777 /tmp/bg

Q 8. You suspect that a particular process is consuming excessive CPU resources on your Linux server. How would you identify and terminate this process?
===> 1. To identify process use 'top' command and get PID of that process
     2. To terminate that process use command 'kill PID'
